### Introduction  
WiredIn is a web application that provide means for uploading individual bank statements to consolidate expenditure across various platforms (credit card, debit & ATM transactions) and reflect information in a visually pleasing structure.   
  
Due to plethora of choices available for modes of payment, it is increasingly difficult for consumers to keep track of their expenditure. Relying on multiple banking mobile applications make it tedious for one to manually consolidate all the transactions across the different platforms - forcing most to manually calculate it using excel sheets. 

WiredIn tries to make this process a little simpler for individuals - by introducing a platform for automatic compilation.

### Usage  
Due to security concerns - since it involved bank statements - this application was not released for the public. However, the screenshots below tells the story of how the application would have been used.  
  
The user would have to download bank statements in the CSV format from his relevant bank accounts and upload it into the web application.

When the user visits the dashboard, he would have a consolidated view of the transactions for the month. If he wants to only view transactions for a particular bank, the interface along the side panels allow for that.

This particular view concerns itself with the calendar; how much the individual had spent on each day of the month.
